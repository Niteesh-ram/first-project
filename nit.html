Basic Structure of a Calendar
Ordinary year: Any year which 365 days is called an ordinary year.Ex: 1879, 2009, 2019, etc.
Leap year: Any year which has 366 days is called a leap year.Ex: 2012, 2016 2020 etc.
The division of the number 365 by 7 gives the quotient 52 and remainder 1 which indicates that an ordinary year has 52 weeks and one extra day. This extra day is referred to as an “odd day” throughout the calendar topics.
A leap year has 366 days, the division of the number 366 by 7 gives the quotient 52 and remainder 2. This indicates that a leap year has 52 weeks and 2 extra days. These two extra days are also referred to as “odd days”.
An ordinary year has one odd day, whereas a leap year has two odd days.

Concept of an Odd Day
A number of odd days in a month

January has 31 days, irrespective of whether it’s an ordinary year or leap year. The division of the number 31 by 7 provides the remainder 3 hence January has 3 odd days. On generalising, any month which has 31 days has 3 odd days and any month which has 30 days has 2 odd days.

The only exception happens is in the case of February. The February month of an ordinary year has 28 days, division of 28 by 7 provides zero as remainder. Hence, the number of odd days in February of an ordinary year will have 0 odd days and that of leap year will have 1 odd day as February in a leap year has 29 days.

The below table depicts the number of odd days in different months of a calendar year:
